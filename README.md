# cowsource
Software Development Term 1 Final Project

## Description
Cowsource is a food-based app that combines the utility of Yelp with the convenience of Tinder. Users can upload pictures of food they've had at restaurants and share them with their friends. Clicking the picture will bring up information about the food and restaurant/eatery it's from, allowing users to go and purchase it themselves if they so choose. Users will also be able to discover food near them based on location data, and establish preferences for restaurants and food.
